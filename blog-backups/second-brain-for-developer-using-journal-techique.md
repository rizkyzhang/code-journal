## Introduction

With much information flowing around us, processing it can be hard and overwhelming that we might sometime fantasize about second digital brain that are connected to us to handle 2X the information. Sadly thing like that is just a science fiction. So it is still possible to maximize our brain capability, yeah it is and quite simple actually, using good old journal, be it physical or digital, I personally use digital journal as it is portable.

Before diving deep into the technique I use, I will explain briefly how our brain works using real life analogy. Our brain have limited capacity which mean it can only store limited information. It mainly stores the information that is important to maintain our life, for example how to eat, speak, write and code. Once an information is deemed unimportant, it will be removed to allocate space for new information. Because our brain have limited capacity, we can think of it as RAM which behave similarly by temporarily storing information as long as the computer is running and once it runs out of memory (in this case our brain is overwhelmed by information) the computer will freeze (we have decision freeze which lead to burnout).

## Technique

I categorized my journal by technology into 3 categories: frontend, backend and devops. Each category will have n subcategories, for example backend is categorized into nodejs and golang, after that the category is further categorized into several topics: cheatsheet, tricks, problems, notes and utils. Cheatsheet contains important notes/commands, tricks contains elegant tricks for a specific task, problems contains description of the problem + solution + reference, notes contains notes about concepts I learned, and finally utils contains utility usually in form of a function.

This is the example of journal directory structure:

```
backend
 golang
  cheatsheet
    cheatsheet-title.md
  notes
    note-title.md
  problems
    problem-title.md
  tricks
    trick-title.md
  utils
    util-title.go
```

Quite simple right? If you want to see real example of the journal, you can check out my journal [here](https://github.com/rizkyzhang/code-journal).

The most important section of the journal is the problems section, if you just want one section in journal, choose problems. Why you might ask? Because by writing down the problem you encountered alongside the solution will give you some great advantages:

- You will save a lot of your time, instead searching google for a problem you have already solved before, you can just look into your journal for the solution
- The time that you save can be directed into more productive tasks such as project planning, fixing bugs and developing important features
- You will learn the technology much faster since learning from mistake is the best way to learn according to scientific research

In my own before experience, before using this technique, I wasted a lot of my time which in turn reduced my productivity, to say that it only slightly improved my productivity is an understatement, it literally changed my life, I no longer need to remember a lot of things since I can just look into the journal, this way my brain can do the the thing it best suited for, storing important information without being overwhelmed.
