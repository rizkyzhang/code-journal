# Introduction

**Programming is the act of constructing a program—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.**

**A programming language is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers**. It is interesting that the most effective way we’ve found to communicate with a computer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other. Like human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be combined in new ways, making it possible to express ever new concepts.

## On Programming

It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own capabilities. You are fine—you just need to keep at it. Take a break, reread some material, and make sure you read and understand the example programs and exercises. **Learning is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier**.

Computers themselves can do only stupidly straightforward things. **The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at an incredibly high speed**. **A program can ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions to do very complicated things**.

Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming. When a program works, it is beautiful. **The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity**. The great program is subdued—made simple in its complexity.

The field of programming is young and still developing rapidly, and it is varied enough to have room for wildly different approaches. There are many terrible mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and make them so that you understand them. **A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules**.

## What is JavaScript

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possible—applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.

It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by marketing considerations rather than good judgment. When JavaScript was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name.

After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International organization that did the standardization. In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they are two names for the same language.
