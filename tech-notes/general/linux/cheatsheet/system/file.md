- There are three categories of files in Linux:
  - General Files – These are ordinary files made up of binary or ASCII data. These are regular files such as documents, images, audio and video files, etc.
  - Directory Files – In Linux, directories are also categorized as files since they also serve as storage space for other files and folders.
  - Device Files – These are special files that provide an interface to device drivers which enable the usability of hardware devices on the system such as mice, keyboards, USB devices, hard drives, etc. These are found in the /dev directory
- Create file1-file5 `touch test{1..5}.txt`
- Zip folder `zip -r <output_file> <folder_1> <folder_2> ... <folder_n>`
