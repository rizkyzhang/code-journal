## Problem

Cannot find namespace Context error in React (TypeScript)

## Solution

To solve the "Cannot find namespace context" error in React typescript, use a `.tsx` extension for the files in which you use JSX, set `jsx` to `react-jsx` in your `tsconfig.json` file and make sure to install all of the necessary `@types` packages for your application.
