- Superclass = parent class
- Subclasses = children class

## Core concepts

- Abstraction = ability of an object to model a real-world object or phenomenon, limited to a specific context.
- Encapsulation = ability of an object to hide parts of its
  states and behaviors from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program.
- Polymorphism = ability of an object to modify specific inherited states or behaviors.
- Inheritance= ability to build new classes on top of existing ones.

- To encapsulate something means to make it private, and thus
  accessible only from within the methods of its own class.
  Thereâ€™s a little bit less restrictive mode called protected that
  makes a member of a class available to subclasses as well.
