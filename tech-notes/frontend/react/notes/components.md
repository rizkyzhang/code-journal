## Components

Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.

React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, `<div />` represents an HTML div tag, but `<Welcome />` represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.

We recommend naming props from the componentâ€™s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
