- Middleware is a function that were called between processing the request and sending the response in an application.
- Middleware is usually used for authentication, error checking and parsing request body.
- You **NEED** `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` for `POST` and `PUT` requests, because in both these requests you are sending data (in the form of json) to the server and it needs to be parsed first so server can read it.
